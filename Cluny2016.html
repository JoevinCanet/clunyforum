    		<p>After 2 successful forums in Cluny in 2013 and in Berlin in 2015 gathering more than 50 participants, Cluny’16 met this year in the city of Lyon from 7th to 9th October to exchange, create and work on inspiring ideas and action plans dedicated to the topic “Digitalization and Youth”.
    		<br><br>During two days the participants worked on digital subtopics, e.g. Education 4.0, Industry 4.0, Start-ups etc., in small groups – working language was English. Guided by open debate professionals and the organization team, the participants got the chance to present their sparkling digital ideas in front of senior business leaders from the corporate sponsors of Cluny’16 and receive their feedbacks. Of course other surprises were planned to have an enriching Cluny’16 journey in Lyon with experience sharing, networking time and more.
    		<br><br>It was also the opportunity to reflect on the achieved actions from the last Cluny Forum and launch new projects to be voluntarily continued after Cluny’16.

          				<h2>1. Digital media and the reshaping of civic engagement</h2>
          				<p>Since few years, we have witnessed how social media can be used to build political campaigns and bring people
together to push for change: Obama campaign in 2008, “Occupy Wall Street” movement and the Arab Spring all come
to mind. How do young people use digital media? Can these tools change their commitment to political and social
causes? On the opposite, is there any risk that digital media reduce their civic and political engagement? Is it possible
to leverage on social media to give birth to a “digital democracy” with a strong commitment of the youth? What can be
a Franco-German perspective?</p>
       				</th>
        			<th class="Group2">
          				<h2>2. French-German digital cooperation and competitiveness</h2>
          				<p>Digitalization deeply transforms both economies and firms, even old industries since digital services are likely to turn
many activities upside down. Despite several cooperative dynamics between France and Germany, there is nothing
with regard to digital transformation. What kinds of cooperation can support the digital transition on both sides of the
Rhine? How to create opportunities of intercompany dialogue and projects? What is missing for working together and
favor a mobility of young professionals, back and forth, that helps share good practices and promote joint projects that
mutually reinforce competitiveness?</p>
       				</th>
       				<th class="Group3">
          				<h2>3. The digital transformation of education and employability</h2>
          				<p>How can people acquire skills and competencies today? It appears that a passive mode of education centered on initial
training is no longer satisfactory to match the requirements of job market. Do young people still need to wait for the
second half of their twenties and to accumulate several diplomas to join the job market? What would characterize
training and learning in a digital world? How can the education/training model be transformed by digitalization,
eventually throughout professional career, in France and Germany? How to validate competencies and involve HR depts.
to support such validation?</p>
       				</th>
       				<th class="Group4">
          				<h2>4. Boosting innovation through digitalization</h2>
          				<p>Can an in-depth transformation of the industry thanks to digitalization open opportunities to develop new industrial
sectors in France and Germany? Is a “digital transition” the sine qua non condition to preserve industrial activities in
Europe? How to promote new ways of innovating to develop and deliver tomorrow’s products and related services?
What are the best rules to benefit from free open innovation and securing the benefits of inventors? As a digital world
helps create many interactions between knowledge owners, do we need to get rid of today’s system of intellectual
property rights (IPRs)?</p>
       				</th>
       				<th class="Group5">
          				<h2>5. A job market without human resources intermediaries</h2>
          				<p>A digitalized job market can favor people’s access to job opportunities and thus reduce unemployment. Can companies
leverage on digital tools to improve the relationship with employees and unemployed? Does it still make sense to
maintain HR departments in today’s digitalized business world where one-to-one interactions are possible? Does such
transformation benefit to employees or can it be detrimental? Can social media preserve a sufficient “Chinese Wall”
between professional applications and personal ones, notably with regard to the tradition of employees-employers
relations in France and Germany?</p>
       				</th>
       				<th class="Group6">
          				<h2>6. The digital customer as the driver of markets</h2>
          				<p>Digital media open new and innovative opportunities to liaise producers and users. Can digitalization turn upside down
the relationship between companies and their customers? Is it likely that companies’ traditional role in designing
products and services disappears? Will digitalization promote a true empowerment of end-users in the value chain?
What can be the contribution of young generations to contribute to such transition of companies in the digitalized
economy, notably in Germany and France? Are companies able to develop an effective use of social media in their
producer-user strategy?</p>
       				</th>
       				<th class="Group7">
          				<h2>7. Digitalization as the last frontier of culture?</h2>
          				<p>Internet revolution has already favored the blossoming of new means and ways to stimulate cultural activities. Can
digitalization push the frontier of cultural creativity? Can we consider digital world as a new, exciting frontier opening new
territories, particularly in France and Germany? Is it necessary to radically change the system of intellectual property
rights? How to find the right balance between the freedom of creators and an economically-sound digitalization? Can
the culture leverage on the best practices in France and Germany to promote a «European way» of digital-fostered
culture?</p>
